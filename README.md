# Airport-Data-Analysis
# ✈️ Airport Data Analysis Project (SQL + Power BI)

This project explores and analyzes airport operations using SQL and visualizes the insights with a Power BI dashboard. The goal is to uncover trends in air travel such as passenger volume, flight frequency, seat utilization, and route efficiency, providing data-driven recommendations for operational improvements.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Airport flight and passenger records
- **Tools Used:**  
  - SQL (Data Analysis & Querying)  
  - Power BI (Interactive Dashboard & Visualization)
- **Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions  
  - CTEs, Filtering, Grouping  
  - Visual storytelling and report building

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze trends in **passenger numbers**, **flight frequency**, and **route popularity**
- Compare **seat utilization** across routes
- Identify **top-performing and underutilized routes**
- Study the **correlation between city population and passenger volume**
- Reveal **seasonal travel patterns**
- Develop actionable **strategic recommendations** for optimization

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Routes with seat utilization under 50% are operationally inefficient.
- Some routes show consistent year-over-year growth, while others decline.
- Peak travel months are not always aligned with flight supply.
- Long-haul high-traffic routes offer expansion opportunities.

## 📌 Sample Problem Statements Solved

1. Total passengers by origin-destination pairs  
2. Average seat utilization per flight  
3. Top 5 busiest routes  
4. Flights and passengers by origin city  
5. Underutilized routes with <50% occupancy  
6. Monthly flight trends over years  
7. Longest and most frequent routes  
8. Year-over-year passenger growth analysis

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard provides rich visuals for the KPIs and trends derived from SQL analysis.

📊 **Key Visuals Include**:
- Passenger volume trends  
- Flight frequency heatmaps  
- Top and bottom performing routes  
- Seasonal demand analysis  
- Seat utilization comparisons
